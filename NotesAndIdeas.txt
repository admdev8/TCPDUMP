NOTES && IDEAS:

+ 1e100.net is Google (sci notation); lots of hits

+ lots of...
	- amazonaws.com
	- cloudfront.net
	- akamaitechnologies.com
	- verizon.com (our ISP)

+ alternatives to full domain, likely for serving other content (ex: fbcdn for Facebook, nflxvideo.net)
	- interesting to see .net used for these instead of .com

+ amazon and 1e100 (Google) show reach of those services, even if it's not the majority of the sites I visit

+ follow URL redirects? (ex: slicehost.com redirects to rackspace)
	- possible in Python: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4902578/1167783
	- request = urllib2.Request(starturl, datagen, headers)
	  response = urllib2.urlopen(request)
	  final_url = response.geturl()
