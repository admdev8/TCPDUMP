# TCPDUMP
A month-long performance documenting every unique server from which my computer attempts to download a file.

TCPDUMP is an online performance, documenting every server my computer connects to over a period of one month. Servers are listed with their DNS or IP address, where they occurred in the overall connection count (multiple connections to the same server are ignored), and geolocation and whois lookup. Data can be sorted using the headers at the top of the page.
